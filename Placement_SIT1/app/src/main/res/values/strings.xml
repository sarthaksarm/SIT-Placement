    The purpose and main aim of developing PlacementSIT app may be the missing piece of many
    unfinished projects, to provide a hand-on
    access with all the company details namely company name, date of visit, its package, eligible
    branch students,
    deadline date, time for registration and link to register upon so that none of student could
    miss any company due to lack of information.
    \nAll the users of the app would be benefited by having an exact handout solution to escape from
    those queues, which ask the same repeated question from
    placement department of our college every time, \"Which is the upcoming company and its
    details?\", in form of PlacementSIT app. It, also,
    becomes problematic to keep track of each company among a list of companies, every day from
    mails, so having all company details at one place would
    make this job simpler and easier.
    It has also been ensured that none of its user other than a SIT student, can access any
    information regarding companies registered in the app.
